## How do I contribute?

For code contributions (bug fixes, new features, etc), jump in here:

1. Read through the [Architecture Guide](../architecture/overview) to understand
   how the ITP code is structured across multiple projects. environment.

2. Ensure you are familiar with our recommended [tools](./tools).

3. Read through the [Installation Guide](../installation) to set up a
   development environment.

4. Browse through the project board and find a
   [good first issue](https://github.com/orgs/gsmainclusivetechlab/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

5. Check the [Writing New Code](./new-code) page to understand more about our
   development workflow.

For new test cases or use cases, you may not need to read the architecture or
installation guides. Instead, review the [Use Case](../testcases/proposing-uc)
and [Test Case](../testcases/creating-tc) creation guides.

## What needs doing?

Work that needs doing is tracked as issues across all test platform
repositories. These are:

- [interop-test-platform](https://github.com/gsmainclusivetechlab/interop-test-platform)
- [interop-docs](https://github.com/gsmainclusivetechlab/interop-docs)
- [interop-mm-simulator](https://github.com/gsmainclusivetechlab/interop-mm-simulator)
- [interop-sp-simulator](https://github.com/gsmainclusivetechlab/interop-sp-simulator)
- [interop-mojaloop-simulator](https://github.com/gsmainclusivetechlab/interop-mojaloop-simulator)
  (forked from [mojaloop/simulator](https://github.com/mojaloop/simulator) )

Github issues from all of these repositories are collected on our
[Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/gsmainclusivetechlab/projects/1).
The best place to start is an issue marked as "good first issue". Alternatively,
anything that is in the backlog and not already assigned to someone is something
we would welcome contributions for.

Once you've picked an issue that you'd like to help with, please leave a comment
in the issue to check that nobody else has already started working (and to stop
anyone else from duplicating your work later!).

If you think there's something missing from the platform but you can't find a
corresponding issue, feel free to create a new one to discuss the new feature.
It's worth doing this _before_ you start working, to make sure that we will
accept the contribution once it's ready.

## Where do I send bugs, questions, and feedback?

For bugs, see the ["Reporting bugs" page](./bugs). If you have any other
questions, or need support in getting started, send an email to
[inclusivetechlab@gsma.com](mailto:inclusivetechlab@gsma.com).
