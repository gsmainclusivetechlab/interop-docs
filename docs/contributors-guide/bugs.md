title: Reporting bugs
---

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Issues are logged on individual project
repositories, but you can view
[all issues](https://github.com/gsmainclusivetechlab/interop-test-platform/issues)
collected together here.

If you'd like to report a new bug, first check that the issue hasn't already
been filed by searching through the board above. If this is a new bug, you can
report it by opening a new issue on the appropriate repository. If you're not
sure which repository is most appropriate for the issue, you can email us
instead at [inclusivetechlab@gsma.com](mailto:inclusivetechlab@gsma.com).

## Write detailed bug reports

Ensure that your report clearly indicates both the behaviour that you _expect_
to see, and the behaviour that you are _actually_ seeing. Ideally, please also
include a list of steps to reproduce the error you are seeing. The project
repository should be pre-configured with appropriate issue templates, so please
try to follow those directions!
