The GSMA Inclusive Tech Lab continues to support the mobile money industry to develop the mobile financial ecosystem, to enable a broad range of digital transactions and make mobile wallets central to the lives of the financially excluded and underserved, providing them with better solutions to manage their financial resources and face economic shocks. Mobile money is poised to evolve from a platform of 500 million accounts to reach more than a billion emerging market consumers, bringing financial access to the previously underserved and excluded.

The GSMA Inclusive Tech Lab has published a set of harmonised Mobile Money Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and now is looking at how to expand the Mobile Money market through interoperability. The GSMA is working with its members, and mobile money industry partners to support the market interoperability using the Mojaloop technology.

This test environment, called as Interoperability Asset, will be a set of simulators to be possible test a two testing scenarios, where the System Under Test(SUT) can be a Service Provider or a Mobile Money Operator, those will lead us to a test environment compose by a portal, test control and 5 simulators where each of them can be replaced for an operational software performing the real functional, but for now just those two entities can be replaced to a real SUT, below a short diagram of the flow.
