### ITP Use Cases <a name="what"></a>

The **ITP Use Cases** are used to capture the system requirements documenting the action of external actors <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> interacting with a system to achieve a specific goal. They map the business and user requisites to demonstrate precisely what to expect from the system. A use case makes possible the understanding of all possible paths through a given user/system interaction. Theses paths include both basic and alternative flows. The basic path (also called happy flow) is the main one and comply with all user needs. Alternative paths include several other situations that are related to the use case, even if they are not frequent or desired (unhappy paths), such as errors for example. In the documentation below it is possible to see all the use cases available in the Interoperability Test Platform. Through this documentation it is possible to understand what types of requirements and its different paths are under test by the platform. To understand better the behaviour of the different tests please see the guide for ITP test cases.
