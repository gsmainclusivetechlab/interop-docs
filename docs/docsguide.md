The documentation exposed here seeks to guide those interested in using the Interoperability Test Platform. The sections available in the sidebar menu cover the main topics needed to understand the platform, its installation and use. As this project is growing and adapting to new requirements, this documentation is dynamic and is constantly evolving to suit to changes.

This documentation is divided into 5 main parts:

1. **Architecture:** It contains information on how the platform is structured, its components and relationships and how the performed tests are addressed by each component.

2. **Installation:** This section details the steps required for local installation of the platform, as well as the installation of components that will be used as System Under Test.

3. **Use Cases:** It has a guide on how Use Cases are approached, which ones are available in the platform, their characteristics and how to create or propose new use cases. This section also shows the use cases under work to be further added to the platform.

4. **Test Cases:** Section with the list of test cases available on the platform grouped by use case and test path (happy and unhappy flows).

5. **User Manual:** It aims to help those who wish to use the platform using a lower technical approach. This section contains instructions on how to create sessions and run tests. This guide uses sample screens to improve user orientation and immersion.
