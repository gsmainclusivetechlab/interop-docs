The documentation exposed here seeks to guide those interested in using the
Interoperability Test Platform. The sections available in the sidebar menu cover
the main topics needed to understand the platform, its installation and use. As
this project is growing and adapting to new requirements, this documentation is
dynamic and is constantly evolving to suit those changes.

This documentation is divided into 5 main parts:

1. **Architecture:** This section contains information on how the platform is
   structured, its components and connections, and how the tests are performed.

2. **Installation:** This section describes the steps required for installation
   of the platform and simulators.

3. **Test Cases:** This section contains a list of the use cases and test cases
   currently available on the platform, and also includes guidance on proposing
   new use cases and creating new test cases.

4. **User Manual:** This section aims to help those who wish to use the platform
   using a lower technical approach. It contains instructions on how to create
   sessions and run tests using sample screens to improve user orientation.
