title: How to Use this Documentation
sidebar_label: Documentation Guide

The documentation exposed here seeks to guide those interested in using the
Interoperability Test Platform. The sections available in the sidebar menu cover
the main topics needed to understand the platform, its installation and use. As
this project is growing and adapting to new requirements, this documentation is
dynamic and is constantly evolving to suit those changes.

This documentation is divided into 5 main parts:

1. **Architecture:** This section contains information on how the platform is
   structured, its components and relationships, and how the performed tests are
   addressed by each component.

2. **Installation:** This section contains the steps required for local
   installation of the platform and simulators, as well as the configuration of
   components that will be used as System Under Test.

3. **Use Cases:** This section contains a guide on how Use Cases are approached,
   which ones are currently available in the platform, and how to create or
   propose new use cases. This section also shows the use cases currently under
   development.

4. **Test Cases:** This section lists all test cases available on the platform
   grouped by use case and test path (happy and unhappy flows).

5. **User Manual:** This section aims to help those who wish to use the platform
   using a lower technical approach. It contains instructions on how to create
   sessions and run tests using sample screens to improve user orientation.
